#Wallah: Helps you install your project's prerequisites

#Prerequisites

* OSX, Linux, or maybe other posix system
* bash
* tar
* curl
* python
  * Yes, this is very meta, but we build virtualenvs by cloning an existing python, not by installing one from scratch. We do this because installing python from source is complicated and slow and has lots of prerequisites.
